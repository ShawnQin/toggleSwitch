# toggleSwitch
##About this program
Here is the brief description of what this program did. For the _toggle switch _ model, there is a integrated program `intrinsicExtrinsicToggleSwitch.m`. It contain all the _fucntions_ needed to do the simulation. There are three different _linear noise approximation_ functions dealing with different amplitude, correlation time scale of extrinsic fluctuation and also the system size effect. We use _Chemical Langevin Equations_ to do the simulation, although _Gillespie Algorithms_ gives qualitatively the same results
